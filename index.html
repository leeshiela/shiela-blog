            Maslow's Heirarchy & COVID-19
          </h3>
          <h4>

              Dear friends,
            </p>
            <p>
              As we move into the 5th week of remote learning, I am exhausted.
              It's been a while since I last wrote and so much has changed.
              We're currently in a pandemic and the largest public school system
              in the nation, NYC public school system, has moved to remote
              learning as people self-quarantine to help protect the elderly and
              immuno-compromised populations of our community.
            </p>
            <p>
              While trying to take care of two toddlers at home and teach
              remotely, my thoughts drift to Maslow's heirarchy and teaching.
              Maslow's heiarchy of needs asserts that in order for
              self-actualization and education of an individual to be met, their
              basic needs like food, shelter, health, safety, and eventually
              love and socialization must be met first. Teaching in
              impoverished/crime-ridden communities and teaching through
              COVID-19 has laid bare that no matter how accessible and thorough
              your lesson, the health and safety of the community comes first.
              Self-actualization cannot happen without those basic needs met. It
              is a privilege to be healthy right now, to be able to stay home,
              and to learn right now. For families that are poor, for families
              of under-represented groups, for families that are caring for sick
              family members, remote learning is impossible. If it is impossible
              to strive for self-actualization, we should indeed strive for love
              and social connection. I'm glad teaching provides that, too.

            Why CS Matters in Communities of Color

              Dear friends,
            </p>
            <p>
              This past weekend, I worked at the event Why Computer Science
              Matters in Communities of Color at Teachers College, Columbia
              University. The event was hosted by NYC Men Teach and CS4ALLNYC.
              It was an incredible opportunity for educators to think about how
              to bring computer science to their schools and to explore how we
              can support communities of color. The conversation around how we
              can make computer science accessible to students of color and
              challenge implicit biases in the tech sector were a highlight of
              mine at this event. Christy Crawford, director of partnerships and
              engagement for CS4ALL, introduced how this time together was going
              to be about "legacies"--legacies that have been come before us and
              legacies awaiting to be made.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Speaking of legacies, the children of two well known computer
              science pioneers were present, one of Katherine Johnson's
              daughters and the children of Jerry Lawson. Katherine Johnson is
              well known for calculating orbital trajectories for NASA and was
              portrayed in the movie Hidden Figures.Jerry Lawson is considered
              one of the founding fathers of the video gaming industry, creating
              the first video game cartridge. It was an honor hearing from all
              of them speak on the panel. I particularly loved the story that
              Katherine Johnson's daughter, Joylette Hylick, shared about a time
              when her mother was in elementary school. Katherine Johnson asked
              the teacher a question about math. When the teacher responded,
              "But, Katherine, you already know the answer to that question."
              The young Katherine answered, "Yes, but they [my classmates] do
              not know the answer."Joylette emphasized that that was how her
              mother always was--kind, compassionate, and always looking to help
              others.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Lawson family also had many stories to share. They talked
              about ​how their father always had the original iterations of many
              technology devices and that many of his favorite devices were kept
              in their family's garage. It wasn't until his children reflected
              in retrospect that their father taught them many things by simply
              explaining and engaging them in conversation at a very young age.

            After participants broke out into workshops to learn about various
            coding and/or robotics programs to bring back to their classroom,
            they were brought back to hear an artificial intelligence (AI)
            expert speak,

          <div>
            <p>
              Joy has been doing outstanding work in breaking down biases in
              facial analysis technology. Her work involves uncovering that the
              algorithms some of the leading companies in facial analysis are
              using, Facebook, Microsoft, etc., would only pick up light, male
              faces. She spoke about how her face could not be detected and that
              there is an "algorithmic bias" by those who control the power and
              technology to write those algorithms. Questioning who creates
              technology and how we must include a broad spectrum of faces and
              give a voice to those who are marginalized, even in artificial
              intelligence, is one of her focuses. Additionally, she created the
              <a href="https://www.ajlunited.org/" target="_blank"
                >Algorithmic Justice League</a
              >
              (AJL) as a way for individuals and companies to come together in
              solidarity to fight "coded biases" and pledge to be inclusive.

              Dear friends,
            </p>
            <p>
              I read this great article in the AFT periodical for educators
              titled
              <a

                >"Does tailoring instruction to "learning styles" help students
                learn?"</a
              >
              by Daniel T. Willingham, a professor of cognitive psychology at
              the University of Virginia. Willingham does a literature review of
              the research done thus far in learning styles and concludes with
              two important implications for education:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              "One educational implication of this research is obvious:
              educators need not worry about their students’ learning styles.
              There’s no evidence that adopting instruction to learning styles
              provides any benefit. Nor does it seem worthwhile to identify
              students’ learning styles for the purpose of warning them that
              they may have a pointless bias to process information one way or
              another. The bias is only one factor among many that determine the
              strategy an individual will select—the phrasing of the question,
              the task instructions, and the time allotted all can impact
              thinking strategies.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              ​A second implication is that students should be taught fruitful
              thinking strategies for specific types of problems. Although
              there’s scant evidence that matching the manner of processing to a
              student’s preferred style brings any benefit, there’s ample
              evidence that matching the manner of processing to the task helps
              a lot. Students can be taught useful strategies for committing
              things to memory,29 reading with comprehension,30 overcoming math
              anxiety,31 or avoiding distraction,32 for example. Learning styles
              do not influence the effectiveness of these strategies."
            </blockquote>

          <div>
            <p>
              As a special education and general education teacher who sees
              students with documented disabilities and students without, I find
              that Willingham's arguments are discerning and offer clarity. Let
              me explain.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              He states that rather than tailor our teaching to students'
              learning styles, we should instead tailor our thinking strategies
              to particular types of problems. This makes sense because all
              students have the capacity to learn in different
              modalities--visual, kinesthetic, auditory, or reading and writing.
              Willingham posits that content can be best taught through a
              modality that best suits the content, not the learning style of an
              individual. This is interesting because I certainly see all of my
              students benefiting from a lesson that involves pictures to
              describe Lenne Lenape Native American vocabulary (visual), making
              corn husk dolls to understand the traditions of the Lenape people
              (kinesthetic), or hearing stories of or about the Lenape tribes
              (auditory). Depending on the content, I can see how educators
              ought to tailor their teaching to the content, rather than having
              only some students engage in one task because they are auditory
              learners, or another task because they are kinesthetic learners.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              When I speak to parents about what type of learner their child is,
              I recognize now that when I classify a learner as having a
              particular learning style of visual, auditory, or kinesthetic it
              can be limiting and misleading because all learners are capable of
              being all of those things. It just depends on the task at hand and
              how to best learn the content through one or many of those
              modalities.

            In Solidarity with Striking Teachers
          </h3>
          <h4>
            April 6th, 2018
          </h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              Dear friends,
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a big supporter of the teacher strikes in West Virginia,
              Oklahoma, and Kentucky, with Arizona on the horizon of a strike.
              It is important that people outside the field of education
              recognize the important role teachers have and begin to treat them
              as other professionals with competitive salaries and benefits.
              While some view teachers as the single agent that can bring about
              change (propaganda brought upon by movies like
              <i>Waiting for Superman</i>), we should recognize that teachers
              have lives of their own, too, and cannot devote every single bit
              of their time to the classroom. From these strikes, we see an
              assortment of educators who work multiple jobs to make ends meet.
              How have the working conditions in this country deteriorated so
              much for teachers, such that it's similar to the working
              conditions of the 1960s (see linked article above)? Salaries are
              despicably low and many states are now right-to-work states, which
              cannot collect dues from members to collectively bargain,
              effectively crippling the union.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              It is inspiring to see the teachers strike despite the
              right-to-work laws. Something is finally being done about the low
              salaries we have endured. Since becoming a mother, time has become
              even more valuable to me and I expect to be compensated for the
              good work I do. I prioritize my time very carefully at
              work--making sure the plans and materials are ready for the week's
              lessons, making sure I differentiate all the lessons so all my
              learners can achieve in their zone of proximal development, and
              making sure I stay on top of my students' IEPs (Individualized
              Educational Plans). However, this work often takes up more time
              than there is in the school day. I am allotted my lunch and one
              prep period per day to do all of those things, so yes, I will take
              work home to finish once my children fall asleep in their beds. I
              wish special education teachers and teachers in general were
              compensated for the many hours they put in to teaching their
              students.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              I think respecting teachers also means respecting and valuing
              their time. Respect the hours teachers work (e.g. end the
              professional development workshop when it is supposed to end so
              teachers can get home to their families) and compensate them for
              extra work they do outside of the school building (e.g. planning
              for math curriculum, preparing for project based learning
              experiences, etc.). The budget is part of the conversation of
              what's wrong with education in America these days. If politicians
              actually valued their teachers, they would prioritize education
              funding and direct it towards teacher salaries instead of the next
              new trendy fad that an outside education consultant with limited
              classroom experience advises.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Unionizing (collective bargaining at its best, even without
              formalized union representation) is important because unions not
              only protect students' interests (e.g. lower class sizes, making
              sure special ed students are entitled to their services, etc.),
              but they also help ensure that their teachers are well rested (not
              working multiple jobs) and have a livelihood of their own. Pay our
              teachers well so that we can raise our families while not having
              to sacrifice the profession we love.
