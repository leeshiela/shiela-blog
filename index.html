        Why CS Matters in Communities of Color

          Dear friends, This past weekend, I worked at the event Why Computer
          Science Matters in Communities of Color at Teachers College, Columbia
          University. The event was hosted by NYC Men Teach and CS4ALLNYC. It
          was an incredible opportunity for educators to think about how to
          bring computer science to their schools and to explore how we can
          support communities of color. The conversation around how we can make
          computer science accessible to students of color and challenge
          implicit biases in the tech sector were a highlight of mine at this
          event. Christy Crawford, director of partnerships and engagement for
          CS4ALL, introduced how this time together was going to be about
          "legacies"--legacies that have been come before us and legacies
          awaiting to be made.

          Speaking of legacies, the children of two well known computer science
          pioneers were present, one of Katherine Johnson's daughters and the
          children of Jerry Lawson. Katherine Johnson is well known for
          calculating orbital trajectories for NASA and was portrayed in the
          movie Hidden Figures.Jerry Lawson is considered one of the founding
          fathers of the video gaming industry, creating the first video game
          cartridge. It was an honor hearing from all of them speak on the
          panel. I particularly loved the story that Katherine Johnson's
          daughter, Joylette Hylick, shared about a time when her mother was in
          elementary school. Katherine Johnson asked the teacher a question
          about math. When the teacher responded, "But, Katherine, you already
          know the answer to that question." The young Katherine answered, "Yes,
          but they [my classmates] do not know the answer."Joylette emphasized
          that that was how her mother always was--kind, compassionate, and
          always looking to help others.

          The Lawson family also had many stories to share. They talked about
          â€‹how their father always had the original iterations of many
          technology devices and that many of his favorite devices were kept in
          their family's garage. It wasn't until his children reflected in
          retrospect that their father taught them many things by simply
          explaining and engaging them in conversation at a very young age.

        After participants broke out into workshops to learn about various
        coding and/or robotics programs to bring back to their classroom, they
        were brought back to hear an artificial intelligence (AI) expert speak,
